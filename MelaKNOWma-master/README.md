# Welcome to MelaKNOWma!
MelaKNOWma is a self-awareness and indicator application designed to help detect early-stage 
skin cancer.

**Important:** This is still a very early stage prototype and is not designed to be used as a self-diagnosis,
use carefully in consultation with a doctor, and always, if there are any concerns go straight
to a qualified medical professional.
